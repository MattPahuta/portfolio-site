      <p>I build responsive, dynamic web apps with Astro, TailwindCSS and React—focusing on clean code, intuitive design, and great user experiences.</p>
      <p>Eager to contribute to dynamic projects while continuously expanding my skills in building scalable and responsive web applications.</p>
      <p>When I'm not deep in development mode, you'll either find me on the tennis court, running along scenic trails, or enjoying a well-earned rest day—while humbly accepting that my pets are the true project managers at home.</p>
